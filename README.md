**Word Counter**

The Word Counter is a Java program that allows users to count the number of words in a given input text or a text file. It provides functionality to process both text input and file input, along with additional features such as counting unique words and displaying word frequencies.

**Features**
Input Options: Users can choose between providing input text directly or specifying a text file as input.
Text Input: If the user chooses to input text directly, they are prompted to enter the text through the console.
File Input: If the user chooses to provide a file, they need to enter the file path. The program reads the content of the file and processes it.
Word Counting: The program counts the total number of words in the input text or file.
Unique Words Count: It also calculates the number of unique words present in the input.
Word Frequency: Additionally, the program displays the frequency of each word in the input text or file.
Input Validation: The program validates user inputs and handles file not found exceptions gracefully.
